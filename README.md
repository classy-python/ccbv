# [Classy Class Based Views](https://ccbv.co.uk)

Django's Generic class-based views provide a lot of common functionality to users.
However, they are made up of up to twelve parent classes or mixins, at the time of writing.
Knowing what functionality comes from which parent class/mixin is a tricky proposition.

CCBV provides a breakdown of each view's inheritance hierarchy, methods, and attributes.
This allows you to find this information without tracing through every file and base class.
